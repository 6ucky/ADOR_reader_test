# ADOR_reader_test

Objectives â–º In this coding test, you will only work on the Named Entity Recognition
(NER) feature of the product. You will provide a Proof of Concept (PoC) to
demonstrate how the tool can parse and extract financial entities from documents.
Depending on the nature of the provided document you can use a rule-based parser, a
NER model or a Large Language Model (LLM).

The data_pipepline is based on a general method which is developped during the mission of GRDF and it can treat the texts, the tables and the images using multi-modal.

The test results are stored in the jupyter notebook.
